        "method_description":"The algorithm is based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a zero-sum game between a Learner (the primal player) and an Auditor (the dual player). The Learner is trying to minimize the sum of the prediction error and a fairness penalty term (given by the Lagrangian), and the Auditor is trying to penalize the fairness violation of the Learner by first identifying the subgroup with the greatest fairness violation and putting all the weight on the dual variable corresponding to this subgroup.
